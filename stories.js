                    <p>The term "dog days" refers to the hottest, most sultry days of summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, they usually fall between early July and early September. In many European cultures, people believed this period brought bad luck.</p>
                    
                    <p>The ancient Greeks and Romans noticed that the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius, would rise just before the sun during the hottest part of summer. Sirius is part of the constellation Canis Major (the Greater Dog), which is why it's called the "Dog Star."</p>

                    <p>A newly discovered ancient worm species reveals fascinating insights into early predatory behavior in Earth's oceans. This remarkable creature lived over 500 million years ago during the Cambrian period.</p>
                    
                    <p>The worm, named Selkirkia columbia, possessed a unique feeding mechanism that allowed it to extend its throat outward to capture prey. This retractable pharynx was lined with sharp, spiky teeth that could grip and tear apart small organisms.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fossil evidence suggests these creatures were among the ocean's top predators during their time, using their specialized anatomy to hunt effectively in the ancient seas.</p>

                    <p>Recently discovered letters and diary entries provide compelling evidence that Queen Victoria may have entered into a secret marriage with her devoted Scottish servant, John Brown, following the death of Prince Albert in 1861.</p>
                    
                    <p>The relationship between Victoria and Brown has long been a subject of speculation among historians. Brown served as the Queen's personal attendant and was known for his unusually close relationship with the monarch.</p>
